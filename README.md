# Persgroep articles app (Meesterproef)

Zishan K. Pasha | V 0.0.1

## Project description

The Persgroep is concepting a app/website that allows young users (20-30) to post articles and browse/read them. So it's new by younger people for younger people. The ultimate goal is to have content which appeals to younger users because it's written by they're peers.

I've been asked to help think out and develop a prototype which showcases a multitude of features and interfaces which would suit the concept that Persgorp has layed before us.

## Project features

I'm focusing on the reader portion of the concept. Which implies that I'll be developing a user interface for the users of the app that want to read articles.

### Must haves

[] Browse articles using a clear interface (overview of articles)
[] Like/rate articles
[] Article page (Way to read the entire article)

### Should haves

* Real time feedback when other readers like/rate an articles
* Search for articles

### Could haves

* Comment on articles
* Moodboard for browsing

### Would haves

* Mongo database connection
* Login/account system

## Installation
### Installing locally

Using the following steps you can install and use the app locally.

#### Cloning or downloading the repo

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Zishrodrigues/meesterproef.git
```
#### Installing the required dependencies
Run the following command in the root:
```
$ npm install
```
Wait for the required npm packages to install and proceed further.

#### Starting and running the server
Make sure port 1337 isn't being used by another project. If this is the case run the following command in the root folder.
```
$ npm run start
```
If you get the message ```app listening in port 1337 ``` the server started successfully on localhost:1337.
